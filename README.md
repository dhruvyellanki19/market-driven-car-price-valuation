# **Market-Driven Car Price Estimation Using Key Vehicle Attributes and Trends**  

## **Overview**  
Car pricing is influenced by various factors, including **brand, mileage, engine size, and year of manufacture**. Traditional pricing methods often fail to **adapt to changing market conditions**, leading to **inconsistent valuations**. This project builds a **machine learning model** that predicts car prices more accurately by analyzing **key vehicle attributes**, ensuring **reliable price estimates** for **buyers, sellers, and businesses**.  

## **Problem Statement**  
Estimating car prices is a challenging task as multiple factors influence the valuation. Factors such as brand, mileage, engine size, and year of manufacture play a significant role in determining a car’s market value. Traditional pricing methods struggle to keep up with rapid market changes, resulting in inaccurate or inconsistent valuations. Businesses, dealerships, and individual sellers often face difficulties in determining a competitive price, which may lead to overpricing or undervaluation of vehicles.  

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can analyze key vehicle attributes and predict car prices with improved accuracy. By implementing techniques such as data cleaning, outlier removal, and feature selection, the model enhances reliability in price estimation. The goal is to provide an efficient pricing tool that helps buyers, sellers, and businesses make informed pricing decisions based on real-world data.

## **Dataset & Features**  
The dataset consists of key vehicle attributes that impact car pricing, including:  
- **Brand & Model** – Determines market demand and perceived value.  
- **Mileage** – Higher mileage often decreases car value.  
- **Engine Size** – Affects performance, fuel efficiency, and pricing.  
- **Year of Manufacture** – Determines depreciation rate and resale value.  
- **Selling Price** – The target variable for model prediction.  

### **Data Processing Steps**  
The data preprocessing phase is crucial to improving model accuracy. The following steps were performed:  
- Identified and removed outliers to ensure reliable predictions.  
- Selected the most influential features to enhance model performance.  
- Applied normalization and transformation techniques to optimize regression accuracy.  

## **Model Development & Evaluation**  
### **Approach**  
The model was developed using a structured machine learning approach that involved cleaning the dataset, selecting the most relevant features, and implementing regression-based prediction models. Various machine learning algorithms were tested to determine the best-performing model. The model was evaluated based on standard performance metrics to assess its accuracy and reliability.  

### **Performance Metrics**  
The model’s performance was evaluated using the following metrics:  
- **R² Score:** 0.6198 – Indicates a moderate correlation between actual and predicted prices.  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 5813.03 – Represents the average deviation in predictions.  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 14649.82 – Highlights the overall predictive error.  

## **Key Findings**  
The model performs well for low and mid-range car prices, providing reliable predictions in these categories. However, predictions for high-value cars show greater variation, indicating the presence of additional influencing factors that are not accounted for in the current dataset.  

The residuals distribution analysis shows that most predictions have minimal error, but some cases exhibit significant deviation. The scatter plot comparing actual and predicted prices reveals that higher-priced cars tend to have a larger variance in prediction accuracy, suggesting the need for additional data points to refine the model.  

## **Conclusion**  
The machine learning model developed for car price prediction provides accurate price estimates by analyzing key factors such as brand, mileage, engine size, and year of manufacture. With an R² score of 0.6198, the model performs well for low and mid-range cars, while predictions for high-value cars show greater variation due to missing influential factors.  

This model can help businesses, dealerships, and pricing analysts improve valuation processes and make better pricing decisions. While it works well for most price ranges, incorporating additional details such as vehicle condition, location, and real-time market demand could further enhance its accuracy, particularly for high-end cars.  

Going forward, this model can be integrated into pricing strategies to help businesses set competitive prices, optimize inventory, and offer better insights to customers. Future improvements can focus on incorporating real-time market trends and advanced machine learning techniques to enhance predictive performance.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
Several improvements can be made to enhance the model’s predictive accuracy. Additional features such as vehicle condition, accident history, and service records could provide deeper insights into pricing trends. Location-based pricing could also improve predictions by factoring in regional demand and supply variations. Real-time market trends could be incorporated to adjust pricing dynamically. Exploring ensemble learning techniques and deep learning models could further improve prediction accuracy, particularly for high-value cars.
